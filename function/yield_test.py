#Yield are used in Python generators. A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
# A Python program to generate squares from 1 
# to 100 using yield and therefore generator 
  
# An infinite generator function that prints 
# next square number. It starts with 1 
def nextSquare(): 
    i = 1; 
  
    # An Infinite loop to generate squares  
    while True: 
        yield i*i                 
        i += 1  # Next execution resumes  
                # from this point      
  
# Driver code to test above generator

for num in nextSquare(): 
    if num > 100:
